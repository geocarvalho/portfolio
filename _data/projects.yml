- name: "RNA-seq Pipeline for Rare Diseases"
  description: "A comprehensive Nextflow-based RNA-seq analysis pipeline built for the UCLA Nelson Lab, designed to run on AWS HealthOmics. Processes paired-end RNA-seq data through quality control (Fastp), contamination detection (rRNA/Globin via BWA), splice-aware alignment (STAR with multiple read-length indices), duplicate marking (Sambamba), gene and transcript quantification (FeatureCounts + Kallisto), intron retention detection (IRFinder), coverage analysis (Mosdepth), variant calling on well-covered coding regions (DeepVariant with custom RNA-seq model), and splice junction analysis (BAM2SJ) — all containerized with Docker and orchestrated through AWS ECR. Built to support the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) and rare disease diagnostics."

- name: "WGS Pipeline for Rare Diseases"
  description: "A Nextflow-based whole genome sequencing pipeline for germline short-read data, built for the UCLA Nelson Lab and designed to run on AWS HealthOmics. Supports FASTQ, BAM, and CRAM inputs with flexible subworkflows. Includes alignment (BWA-MEM2), duplicate marking (Picard), SNV/indel calling (DeepVariant), structural variant detection (Manta), copy number analysis (CNVpytor), repeat expansion detection (ExpansionHunter + ExpansionHunterDenovo), haplotype phasing (HapCUT2), runs of homozygosity (AutoMap), and comprehensive QC (Fastp, Qualimap, Picard metrics, MultiQC). All tools containerized with Docker and orchestrated through AWS ECR."
