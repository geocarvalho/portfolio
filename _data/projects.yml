- name: "RNA-seq Pipeline for Rare Diseases"
  description: "A comprehensive Nextflow-based RNA-seq analysis pipeline built for the UCLA Nelson Lab, designed to run on AWS HealthOmics. Processes paired-end RNA-seq data through quality control (Fastp), contamination detection (rRNA/Globin via BWA), splice-aware alignment (STAR with multiple read-length indices), duplicate marking (Sambamba), gene and transcript quantification (FeatureCounts + Kallisto), intron retention detection (IRFinder), coverage analysis (Mosdepth), variant calling on well-covered coding regions (DeepVariant with custom RNA-seq model), and splice junction analysis (BAM2SJ) — all containerized with Docker and orchestrated through AWS ECR. Built to support the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) and rare disease diagnostics."

- name: "WGS Pipeline for Rare Diseases"
  description: "A Nextflow-based whole genome sequencing pipeline for germline short-read data, built for the UCLA Nelson Lab and designed to run on AWS HealthOmics. Supports FASTQ, BAM, and CRAM inputs with flexible subworkflows. Includes alignment (BWA-MEM2), duplicate marking (Picard), SNV/indel calling (DeepVariant), structural variant detection (Manta), copy number analysis (CNVpytor), repeat expansion detection (ExpansionHunter + ExpansionHunterDenovo), haplotype phasing (HapCUT2), runs of homozygosity (AutoMap), and comprehensive QC (Fastp, Qualimap, Picard metrics, MultiQC). All tools containerized with Docker and orchestrated through AWS ECR."

- name: "Single-Cell RNA-seq Pipeline"
  description: "A Nextflow pipeline for processing 10x Genomics single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-seq data, built for the UCLA Nelson Lab and designed to run on AWS HealthOmics. Wraps Cell Ranger for gene expression quantification and cell calling, with FastP for QC, automatic BAM-to-CRAM conversion for 40-60% storage savings on S3, and MultiQC for aggregated reporting. Supports configurable chemistry detection, adjustable expected cell counts, and optional alignment file generation — all containerized with Docker via AWS ECR."
