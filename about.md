## About Me

I’m George Carvalho, a Healthcare Data Scientist and Bioinformatician specializing in clinical genomics, large-scale sequencing analysis, and workflow automation. I build scalable, reproducible pipelines and data systems that transform complex genomic data into actionable insights for research and patient care.

Currently at UCLA Health, I analyze whole genome and RNA sequencing data for rare disease patients, develop cloud-based pipelines, and generate clinical genomics reports that support diagnostic decision-making. My work focuses on improving variant detection, structural variation analysis, and the efficiency and reliability of genomic workflows.

Previously, I worked at G42 Healthcare developing large-scale genomics analysis solutions, and at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein supporting clinical sequencing pipelines and validation processes. These experiences strengthened my ability to operate in regulated clinical environments and collaborate across multidisciplinary teams.

My technical expertise spans Python-based data science, workflow orchestration (Nextflow, Snakemake, WDL), cloud computing (AWS HealthOmics, DNAnexus), and multi-platform sequencing technologies including Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore. I am particularly interested in building robust bioinformatics infrastructure that enables precision medicine and accelerates scientific discovery.

I thrive in collaborative environments where science, engineering, and medicine intersect, and I am driven by the opportunity to develop solutions that directly improve patient outcomes.

### Core Strengths

- Clinical genomics & rare disease analysis
- NGS pipeline development & workflow automation
- Cloud & high-performance computing (AWS, DNAnexus)
- Variant calling, CNV & structural variation analysis
- RNA-seq and multi-omics integration
- Reproducible research & data engineering best practices

### Interests

- *Professional interests*: I enjoy working in clinical bioinformatics, building and optimizing analysis pipelines, evaluating new tools and methodologies, and strengthening the statistical foundations behind genomic data interpretation.

- *Personal interests*: Outside of work, I value spending quality time with my wife and friends, exploring new places together, and trying different cuisines. I also enjoy experimenting with new sports and practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as my primary form of exercise and stress relief.
